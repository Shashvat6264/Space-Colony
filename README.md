2. After every bullet fired the color of your spaceship will change randomly along with color of the bullet.
3. The player must hit the UFO of the same colour as the Ship and Bullet.
4. Score is calculated by number of UFOs hit.

Dealing with anonyous....
The colour of the spaceship becomes white with red coloured wings, the bullet becomes a star and the yellow colour UFO needs to be shot.
